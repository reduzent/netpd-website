## Community

  * Need help?
  * Want to share thoughts?
  * Want to know about jams?
  * Want to know what's up?
  * And more?

Of course, the best way to interact with other people using netpd is through
netpd itself. If no one else is online on netpd, then you might have some
more luch reaching people through one of the other channels.
