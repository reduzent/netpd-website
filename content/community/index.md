## Community

  * Need help?
  * Want to share thoughts?
  * Want to know about jams?
  * Want to know what's up?
  * And more?

Of course, the best way to interact with other people using netpd is through
netpd itself. If no one else is online on netpd, then you might have some
more luck reaching people through one of the other channels.

### Visit:

##### Discussion Forum

- https://untalk.netpd.org (activity has declined for a while)

##### Discord server

- https://discord.gg/3FYRbTMhpG (a little more activity there)

##### IRC

- **irc.libera.chat**:6697
- Channel: **#netpd** (very little activity)

### Jam:

Some jams take place on regular or semi-regulare schedules. Feel free
to join:

- **Thursday Evening @ 21pm (UTC)**  
  This is usually quite an interesting and fun jam with an open-minded
  and curious attitude, where never-heard-before sound territory is
  explored and instruments are used in unforseen ways.
- **Friday Morning @ 8am (UTC)**  
  ~~This jam is usually more focussed on ambient and athmospheric music.
  Jams often start with building a structure in order to record a
  "listenable" piece later.~~ Unfortunately, this jam has been halted
  for a while due to personal circumstances of a core member.
  We're looking forward to pick it up again as soon as possible.

##### Netiquette
When joining an already running session, make yourself familiar with
what is going on (maybe your peers are in the middle of a recording).
Say hi and ask what people are working on. Feel free to contribute.
It's common practice that people work on instruments that they loaded
themselves. But it is normally OK for anyone to tweak any instruments.
Do not close instruments without notice. Learn to appreciate how
things emerge. But then, sessions often profit from novel input of a
fresh mind that shakes things up a bit.

Recordings from online sessions are considered nobody's property and
sharing results on public forums is the rule.
